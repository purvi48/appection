An insight of iTunes App Store popular apps. Cooperating with my teammates Wenzhe Wu and Aditya Kismatrao. Many thanks to Ms. Dahlin and our TA Horace for all the helps and advices.

P.S. If you want a quick view through the project, download the .html file. You have to use juypter notebook to check out the iPyWidget within the .ipynb file. Also you will need to install WordCloud Package if you wanna run it.
